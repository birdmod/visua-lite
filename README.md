# visua-lite
Web visualizer for sqlite3 tables in a grouped manner to have quick insight of data.

# Origin
I applied for a company which gave me an assignment to do on my own.

The goal was to create a web application to read a sqlite3 file, select a column of the unique table then show 
for each value of this column the number of rows with this value and the average of specific column.
This, as a Single Page Application.

While my solution did not meet their satisfaction, I decided to not giving up and improve it a bit based on 
my ideas and the absence of feedback on my solution from the interviewer. 

# Technologies
There was no mandatory technology or programming language so my choice was a mix 
of known stuff, forced decisions, and being _very_ motivated because I couldn't wait to see the product of my 
knowledge being having worked more with software than web : 

## Server side stack known for the web
Last time I practiced PHP5 was 6 years ago for work so I did not have time to ramp up again AND I needed a *quick result*

I programmed in node.js when it was not hype yet at school. I had an immediate vision of how to achieve SPA-ness 
with socket.io as I used it. But with the pleasure of going back to level 1 in this technology.

## Client side stack
Some HTML5 (cf node.js) and basic CSS.
